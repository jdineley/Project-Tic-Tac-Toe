# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

Not pretty, but built with sound foundational logic with focus on separation of concerns and can be played entirely in the console. Rendering to the screen happens after the play logic is dealt with behind the scenes.  This makes for easier exensibility if the game should be enhanced or made to look prettier without messing with the play logic.
